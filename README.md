Science gateways represent potential targets for cybersecurity threats to users, scientific research, and scientific resources. Custos is a software framework that provides common security operations for science gateways, including user identity and access management, gateway tenant profile management, resource secrets management, and groups and sharing management. The goals of the Custos project are to provide these services to a wide range of science gateway frameworks, providing the community with an open-source, transparent, and reviewed code base for common security operations; and to operate trustworthy security services for the science gateway community using this software base. To accomplish these goals, we implement Custos using a scalable microservice architecture that can provide highly available, fault-tolerant operations. Custos exposes these services through a language-independent Application Programming Interface that encapsulates science gateway usage scenarios.


Following diagram illustrate the architecture of the Custos Software.

## Quickstart

## Installation Instructions

### Setup Custos for local development

#### Prerequisites

* Java 17

* Docker installed on local environment 

* Maven 3.6.x

#### Clone the repository
  ```
    git clone -b develop https://github.com/apache/airavata-custos.git
    
  ```

#### Build source code
  
  Following  command builds the Custos source code and create two docker images of custos_core_server and custos_integration_server
  
  ```
    cd airavata-custos
    mvn clean install
  ```
  
#### Run Custos on docker
  
Following command starts Custos main services and its depend services. All services are listed below and you should be able to
access them locally if all services are correctly started.

  - Dependent Services
    * Keycloak (http://localhost:8080/auth/)
    * MySQL (0.0.0.0:3306)
    * HashiCorp Vault (http://localhost:8201/)
    * CILogon (Not available for local development)
    
  - Custos Services
    * Custos Core Service (0.0.0.0:7001 (grpc port))
    * Custos Integration Service (0.0.0.0:7000 (grpc port))
    * Custos Rest Proxy (http://localhost:10000(envoy proxy)
    
  ```
     cd custos-utilities/ide-integration/src/main/containers
     docker-compose up
  ```

#### Bootstrapping Custos  Super Tenant
  
If all services were successfully ran. Custos bootstrap service needs to be run to create a  Super tenant to launch Custos Portal
   ```
    cd custos-utilities/custos-bootstrap-service/
    mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
The above command should create the super tenant and it outputs super tenant credentials. Copy those credentials to configure
Custos Portal.

```
Note: Make sure to clean up old databases for fresh start.
```

#### Install Custos Portal Locally

Follow the following link to access portal deployment instructions

[Custos Portal](https://github.com/apache/airavata-custos-portal/blob/master/README.md)

You have to configure following properties in the .env file

```
CUSTOS_CLIENT_ID="SUPERT TENANT ID CREATED FROM ABOVE STEP"
CUSTOS_CLIENT_SEC="SUPERT TENANT CREDENTIAL CREATED FROM ABOVE STEP"
CUSTOS_API_URL="http://localhost:10000"
CUSTOS_SUPER_CLIENT_ID="SUPERT TENANT ID CREATED FROM ABOVE STEP"
UNDER_MAINTENANCE=False
```

## Custos Integration With External Applications
Custos can be integrated with external applications using Custos REST Endpoints, Python SDK, or Java SDK.

### Integrate Using Java SDK
In order to perform this operation you need to have a already activated tenant in either Custos Managed Services or Your own deployment.
Following instructions are given for locally deployed custos setup which can be extended to any deployment,

####Initializing Custos Java SDK

* Add maven dependency to your project
```<dependency>
   <groupId>org.apache.custos</groupId>
   <artifactId>custos-java-sdk</artifactId>
   <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

* Initialize Custos Client Provider in your application
```
 CustosClientProvider custosClientProvider = new CustosClientProvider.Builder().setServerHost("localhost")
                    .setServerPort(7000)
                    .setClientId(CUSTOS CLIENT ID) // client Id generated from above step or any active tenant id
                    .setClientSec(CUSTOS CLIENT SECRET)  
                    .usePlainText(true) // Don't use this in production setup
                    .build();
```
Once above step is done, you can use custos available methods for  authentication and authorization purposes
* Sample client code to register and enable a User

```
 UserManagementClient userManagementClient =  custosClientProvider.getUserManagementClient();
 userManagementClient.registerUser("jhon","Smith","testpassword","smith@1",
                    "jhon@email.com",false);
 userManagementClient.enableUser("jhon");
 OperationStatus status =  userManagementClient.isUserEnabled("Jhon");
```
##### 
### Deploy Custos on remote server

Follow the Ansible based deployed instructions. see documentation [here](ansible/README.md)
